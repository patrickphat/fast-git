*No longer wait to another git push..*

</div>

Why do we have spend too much time on `git add`, `git commit` and `git push` while we can use a single command `fgit push`

## Installation
```bash
pip install fgit
```

## Usage
Run this command at git folder and run through its push prompt.
```bash
fgit push
```
